#OOP Assignment Task 1
1.import mother and father attribute
2. add two new attributes in the child constructor


class Father():
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = None
        self.fname = None
        self.color = ' Fair'
        self.hair_color = 'Black'
        
    def speak(self):
        return "Pakistan Zindabad!"
        
class Mother():
    def __init__(self):
        self.height = '5.5 feet'
        self.color = 'white'
        self.weight = '100 pounds'
        
    def slient(self):
        return "..."
    
class Child(Mother,Father):
 def __init__(self):
        Mother.__init__(self)
        Father.__init__(self)
        self.Qualification = None 
        self.age = None
        
c1 = Child()
print([i for i in dir(c1) if "__" not in i])


# Task2: Create operator overloading
class Scores ():
    def __init__(self, TeamInd , TeamPak):
        self.Team1 = TeamInd
        self.Team2 = TeamPak
    def __add__(self,other):
        Team1 = self.Team1 + other.Team1 
        Team2 = self.Team2 + other.Team2
        Total = Scores(Team1 ,Team2)
        return Total
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Team1 Score is {self.Team1}  Team2 Score is {self.Team2}"
    
semifinal = Scores(120,100)
final  = Scores(190,110)

Match_Total = semifinal + final

print(Match_Total)
